Includes extensions of timing related factory and data factory classes, which are
{@link org.tubs.epoc.SMFF.SystemFactories.TimingFactories.AbstractTimingFactory AbstractTimingFactory} and
{@link org.tubs.epoc.SMFF.SystemFactories.TimingFactories.AbstractTimingFactoryData AbstractTimingFactoryData}.

This package includes implementations of UUniFast algorithm which
is presented in Bini, E. & Buttazzo, G. Measuring the Performance of Schedulability Tests Real-Time Syst., 
2005, 30, 129-154. This algorithm
guarantees that the load on the resource is as specified in the parameters and that the distribution of task
utilizations is uniformely distributed.
