Includes resource related classes. There are both abstract classes, such
as {@link org.tubs.epoc.SMFF.ModelElements.Platform.AbstractResource
AbstractResource}, aimed to be extended by special resource
implementations, and several resource implementations which can be used
directly. Two of the implementations are: {@link
org.tubs.epoc.SMFF.ModelElements.Platform.Resource Resource}, {@link
org.tubs.epoc.SMFF.ModelElements.Platform.CommResource CommResource}.
